## Methodology

Meteostat has a package to download weather data by point location. Using this package, I downloaded and used hvplot to plot trip count data against average temperature, precipitation and average wind speed by month. After this, I used seaborn to make a Pearson Correlation chart to see which weather feactors affected ridership during 2020 and 2021.

In the second half, I used OSM's package to download point data for the following amenities: educational institutes (schools, colleges and universities), restaurants, public transit stations and bikes shops. I created a dataset of the distances of Indego and Blue Bikes stations and these amenities, which is used in Part 3.

## How does weather affect bike ridership?

In this section, we explore how temperature, wind and precipitation have affected bike ridership.
